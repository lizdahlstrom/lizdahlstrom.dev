I created Ziggato as a side project along with my studies. I had used Wikipedia API for a uni project and wanted create a utility for a small Discord server used by myself and some friends. As time went on I added more and more features.

## What can Ziggato do?

A Discord bot built with the help of DiscordJS API and NodeJS. Ziggato can do the following:

- Get gifs from Giphy
- Convert currencies
- Get a variety of jokes
- Display lyrics
- Display games that are in common between Steam users
- Translate text using Google translate
- Unit conversion
- Create Watch2Gether rooms
- Search and display Wikipedia entries
- Show synonyms or rhymes of words

## Deployment

I deployed the bot on a Ubuntu server hosted in the cloud. Using Github actions I set up a pipeline for continuous delivery and deployment.
